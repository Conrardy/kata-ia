# Welcome to the Project Structure Guide Tour!

As a new developer, it's essential to understand how our codebase is organized. Here's a concise overview of each directory and its purpose:

1. **TrainOffice**
   - This is the root directory of the project. It contains the main solution and configuration files necessary for the project setup and operation.

2. **Configuration**
   - The `Configuration` directory manages the setup and initialization of various parts of the application, such as application-wide settings, data configurations, and persistence settings.

3. **Features**
   - The `Features` directory is organized by specific functionalities or modules within the application. Each feature folder contains subdirectories for:
     - **Presentation**: Handles incoming requests and user interactions, such as controllers or UI components.
     - **UseCases**: Defines the application's business logic and specific actions or processes related to the feature.
     - **Domain**: Contains shared business logic and entities used across multiple features.

4. **Infrastructures**
   - The `Infrastructures` directory contains all implementations related to data storage and external service integrations. It is organized by the type of technology or storage method, such as in-memory storage or database-specific implementations.

5. **Shared**
   - The `Shared` directory holds code and resources used across multiple features. It includes shared services and utility functions that provide common functionality to avoid duplication.

6. **Tests (TrainOffice.Tests)**
   - This directory is dedicated to testing and includes unit tests to verify individual components of the application. It ensures code quality and reliability.

7. **Properties**
   - The `Properties` directory contains settings and configurations specific to the project or development environment, such as local development settings.
