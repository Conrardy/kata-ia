# Refactoring

This is a simple Elixir console application for a refactoring Kata. It includes a service for handling assertion actions and corresponding tests.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Elixir installed. Follow the instructions on the [official Elixir website](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) for your operating system.

## Todos

[] Add missing tests in AssertionActionServiceTest (what happen if you remove one if)
[] Refactor validate_mandatory_claims (remove duplication)
[] Refactor get_assertion_action_response (test for true not for false)
